        </div>

      

        <p>
            On September 29, 2024 Neg.Or Medical Society (NOMS) Fun Run was held at Dumaguete Boulevard and led by Dr.
             Paolo Tabaluc. It was a fundraising activity with the Society of Pharmaceutical Associates of Negros. 
             I participated in running the event and I ran 5KM. The call time was 4:30 a.m. and the 
            race started at 5 AM for 10KM and 5:10 a.m. for the 5KM. I finished my run at 5:39 so my running time is 29 minutes. After my run, I 
            received my meal and left at around 6 a.m.
        </p>
             
        <p>
            During the event, I discovered that my running time had significantly changed.
            I used to be able to run 20 minutes for 5k but due to my inactivity, it changed drastically. 
            But I was already expecting the results to be not so good since I stopped running for a few months.
            But despite that, I still ran even though it hurts to see bad results. During the events a famous group
            of runners called "Spectrum Runners" was participating in the event. They're the strongest team of runners
            here in negros and they have athletes all over Visayas. With that background, I already know that they
            will take the reward. Their runners are exceptionally fast and I could only keep up with them for the
            first few minutes from the starting time. But still, it was a good experience to be able to run again 
            and the most difficult part of the event was me not being able to perform as I used to.
            Although my performance was not great, I am still grateful that I can run.


        </p>

        <p>
            While running I witnessed myself being overtaken by other runners and it made me realize how weak I was.
            But I tried to keep a positive mind and say to myself that everyone has their own pace and I would just try 
            my best to finish the race without stopping and so I did. I think this can be applied to real-world situations
            like everyone has their own pace in life and it's okay to be left out and the only thing that should matter is to not give up.
            It was my first time hearing of NOMS but they seem to be a nice group of people who value their health and I want to
            be around people like that. My cousin who is a member of NOMS is the one who invited me to the event and it was a last-minute 
            registration by keeping in touch with my cousin I can participate in their events more.
            Raising Funds towards running is a great idea since the participants and 
            the organizer of the event can benefit from it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I can now see my physical capabilities and that there is a lot
            of room for improvement. With that, I will just continue to improve myself and  I will just do better next time.

         <h2> CCS Intramural Try Outs for Chess</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>
            On October 16, 2024, there was a chess tryout for the CCS intramurals and I tried my luck by joining the event.
             Hosted by Cyra Dagoy of the sports committee, it was held on Silliman at ATA Hall and it started at 3 p.m. and I forfeited
             and ended at 5:30 p.m. since I had a class. The objective of the event was to gather students from the CCS who had
             promising chess skills to represent the college during intramurals. I was a participant in this event and my
             standing was one win, one loss, and one draw. I played a total of 3 games and I lost because I had a class. 



        </p>
             
        <p>
            It was my first time to be in a actual chess tournament and I did not know that it would be so mentally exhausting.
             My initial expectation of the event was to just try out my current skills and to just have fun. But I did not expect
             it to take a toll on me mentally. It was a first for me to experience mental tiredness at that level. During
             the event to be so exhausting, I encountered several people who were good at the game.  But the person who stood out to me the most
             was a classmate, Dominic Balinas. I did not know that he was good at the game and he did not have any intention
             of winning but still won all of his matches. Although he did not qualify since like me, he had a class also.
            He was so humble about not knowing how to play that he ended up beating his opponents.

        </p>
            
           
        <p>
            In my experience of the tryout, I learned to not underestimate chess as a sport.
            It is a mental game and will take a huge toll on one's body resulting in individuals who are not use to the event become extremely tired. 
            The games that I played were good and I liked the opponents since they showed proper sportsmanship.
            But it was really cold at ATA hall so I would often go out to warm myself. It was a good event and as for my values, 
            I should respect chess more and to be more prepared on tournaments. The game chess is not a physical sport but it can make a person tired mentally if played for hours. If I will join another chess tournament then I will be more prepared mentally. I'm glad that the event went smoothly even though I did not qualify I'm still happy to participate as for the organizers they did 
            a great job hosting the event and I'll stay active in the GC to see if they will host more events so that I can join.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this event, I am not aware of how serious chess players are especially in big tournaments. 
            I used to watch tournaments online but I can't image how they handle the mental challenge of the game. 
            I'll take this as a learning lesson to be more mentally prepared if I will join another chess competition.

            On October 27, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m, there was a Inter Town Volleyball Tournament Finals happening at the 
            Lamberto Macias Gymnasium. 
            It was a championship match between Dumaguete City and Sta. Catalina (My hometown). Organized by the Negros Oriental 
            Volleyball Associataion(NORVA), the main goal of the tournament was to find out who has the best volleyball 
            team in Negros Oriental. I was a spectator of this since it was my hometown against a powerhouse team which is team Dumaguete.
        </p>
             
        <p>
            While spectating, I observed that the players were really into the game and determined to win and as a fellow 
            athlete I respect that and I can take inspiration from this. Before the match started, I was hoping that my hometown
             could become a champion since it would be a huge achievement if they defeat Team Dumaguete. But unfortunately, 
             team Sta. Catalina fell short and team Dumaguete took the championship title. I was saddened, because I genuinely 
             hoped that my hometown could take the title but the result was inevitable. During the match I saw my old school 
             mate and friend Queen Lee, participating in the game and when I realized the she was in the main line up I was excited 
             to see her perform. She did great, and so did her other teammates but it was not enough to defeat their opponents. But 
             despite the loss, I was still happy that my hometown achieved 1st place since it was really a hard-fought battle against 
             team Dumaguete.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a person who is really into sports, I become emotional but then I realized that losing is normal and the loss can be
             taken as a motivation to further improve one’s lapses. The NORVA team really did a great job organizing the event, and I to keep up with 
             international judges the event went smoothly and I will keep in touch with their group by following their page for
             what they will be up to next I will wait for further announcement in their page. 
             The activity is beneficial for volleyball enthusiast to showcase their 
            talents and proudly represent their own municipality and the organizers did 
            a really great job so there were no issues.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I was able to witness my hometown go against a power house team like Dumaguete and still showed goods results. Especially since I was also to witness my old friend being one of the main line up of the team. 
            It was a fantastic match and their defeat can be used as motivation to further improve their power as a team.

            A TEKKEN 8 elimination match and a finals final match was happening at the Dumaguete Convention Center on 
            November 2, 2024, hosted by the Esports Negrense League. From 10:00 a.m. it started the elimination round.
             During our arrival at around 5:00 p.m, we witnessed a few matches of the elimination round and it then proceeded
              to the quarter-finals, following the Semifinals, fight for third, and at 6 AM the finals match began. Together
               with my friend, we spectated even though we can't relate much to Tekken since we do not play the game but we can 
               somewhat understand the concept of the game. On my end, I witnessed players showing accurate movements and fast
                reaction time to dodge and react to their opponent's movements and respond with precise counterattacks. The 
                objective of the tournament was
             to promote Esports in Negros Oriental and show that there are players who have exceptional skills in the game.
        </p>
             
        <p>
                
            On the multiple games that we watched, I realized that anything can happen.
             Even if a person is already about to lose, they can still have a chance to recover 
             from their opponent's attack and turn the tables around. My initial expectation of the event 
             is that there will be plenty of people who will come and spectate since it is a final match of 
             the Buglasan Tekken 8 tournament. But most of the seats were empty which surprised me and made me 
             question if Tekken is not that popular anymore. But despite the lack of spectators the players did 
             their best to try and claim the championship title and Glyde Villaflores was the one who reigned above 
             all the 32 participants. He showed the determination to dominate the battles that he fought and I can say this 
             because he did not lose a single round to any of his opponents. Although the event was a little bit of 
             scheduled since at 3 PM the Tekken tournament should have been done but we still finished the Tekken tournament 
             patiently waiting for ML to begin. The awarding of the Tekken match began at 7 PM which is late on the schedule 
             that they provided but I guess anything can happen.

        </p>

        <p>
            It was a boring experience since only a few people that was showing support. Only the organizers, 
            a few supporters, the players, and us 2 were in the venue. But I guess this is because the games were broadcast live online.
             Even if there were a few people around. Despite all that I admire the organizers for including Esports in the Buglasan since
              Teekken enthusiast will have something to look forwards to every year and maybe gamers all around Negros will be inspired
               and pursue their passion for gaming. 
            But a few changes could be made such as advertising the event so that more people will be aware of the event. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            Because of this activity, I realized that Tekken 8 is not as popular as other Esports games. This is because only a few people were at the event. With that, I hope the game can get more recognition since it seems like the game is almost dying for only a few people showed support in the recent Buglasan tournament.

            After all the matches finished in Tekken 8, The 5th Buglasan Championship Title for Mobile Legends followed through. Held at 
            the Convention Center in Dumaguete City, it started at 8 p.m. ended at around 10 p.m. Additionally, it was organized by the Esports 
            Negrense League. There were 58 teams in total and the team that clinched the champion spot was MDVPRS (Madvapers) LEGENDS winning 
            against their co-squad mate MDVPRS Esports. They showcased proper coordination with their teammates, executed team fights wisely, 
            and did not commit to any clash that would put them out of their favor. Both teams performed exceptionally but the reason why MDVPRS 
            Esports lost was mainly due to their lack of mechanics and, they were out drafted by their opponent. The objective of the tournament 
            was to promote Esports in Negros Oriental and show that there are players who have exceptional skills in the game. I was a spectator 
            of the match and together with my friend who is also a Mobile Legend enthusiast, we witnessed a good battle between two great teams.

        <p>
            As I continue to observe I thought about why newer games like Valorant are gaining popularity fast. Then, I figured out the answer and 
            it is because there are plenty of popular streamers playing the game. Before the tournament began, I did not know much about the teams 
            that were participating but I made a hunch that the team THE RITUALS would be the one to take the spot of the champion mainly because 
            I find their team name to be strong. I was surprised to find out that I was right. Not only are their name strong they also sweep 
            their opponents. With a score of 12-4 in the last round. They had an 8-round advantage against E-BOYS. The usual Valorant match would 
            last an hour or more but their match was 40 minutes only. It showed how dominant THE RITUALS are. The only thing that made the 
            Valorant tournament a little longer was their warm-up. During the tournament, 2 players dominated the match and it was Maki and 
            Blik of THE RITUALS they were the ones carrying the team and it was really fun to watch.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was an entertaining match that's for sure but I kind of took pity on E-BOYS since they lost with their opponents having such a 
            huge lead against them. I think I can get a lesson here if I put myself in their perspective, I can further improve the things that 
            I am doing since there will always be people better than me. The organizers did a great job in handling the Valorant tournament 
            and I think they will continue to do a great job in the future and to be involved with them I will follow their page for updates 
            regarding the things that they will do. This activity is beneficial not only to the organizers but also to the players that wants 
            to experience being in a Valorant tournament.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I am surprised by how players can be so strong and make it look easy to display their skills. 
            Take Maki and Blik for example. They were the ones taking the lead of the team and on an interview, Maki had a message to 
            their opponent saying “Kulang silage practice pero mas daghan sila og practice namo.” Translate that to English it means that 
            their opponents were having plenty of practice matches but it was still not enough to beat them. To be able to say phrases like 
            that you need to have exceptional skills. It just proves how confident he is.

            the things that they will do. This activity is beneficial not only to the organizers but also to the players that wants to experience 
            being in a Valorant tournament.

        <p>
            Because of this activity, I am surprised by how players can be so strong and make it look easy to display their skills. Take Maki 
            and Blik for example. They were the ones taking the lead of the team and on an interview, Maki had a message to their opponent saying 
            “Kulang silage practice pero mas daghan sila og practice namo.” Translate that to English it means that their opponents were having plenty 
            of practice matches but it was still not enough to beat them. To be able to say phrases like that you need to have exceptional skills. It 
            just proves how confident he is.

            After the Valorant match the 7th BUGLASAN championship title for DOTA2 was played next. 
            Hosted by the Esports Negrsense League on November 3, 2024, at Ground Zero Dumaguete City. The finals match started at 3 p.m. and it ended at 5 p.m. and 
            it was played by JOTENKS versus HARING INASAL and like the other tournaments that was organized by the Esports Negrense League the objective is to promote 
            Esports in the Province. In the tournament I was just a spectator witnessing local players showcasing their skills in the game. In my personal opinion I 
            think that DOTA2 is the most difficult out of the other 3 games that was hosted by Esports Negrense League. I know this since I used to play the game but 
            its so time consuming and I find the mechanics hard to grasp. 
        </p>
             
        <p>
            During this tournament I learned that out of all the Esports I spectated this was the most toxic. I expected it to be a normal finals match but as I 
            continue to watch the players were talking trash to each other and the organizers did nothing about it. It was entertaining at first but as I continue 
            to spectate it became a nuisance so I left and continue to watch the game online. It was a negative experience on my side due to the lack of sportsmanship 
            the players are showing. I wanted to witness firsthand how the players interact in game and also how they communicate since DOTA2 is a hard game for me. 
            I did not try to argue and tell the organizers since they were already aware of what was happening so I just left and watched the matches continue in the 
            comfort of my home. It was a close match and there was not really anyone taking the lead it’s just that HARING INASAL since they found a way to disrupt 
            their opponent and it is by attacking them while their opponents are off guard.
        </p>

        <p>
            told to my self maybe this is just how the DOTA2 community is and it changed my perception on them. I may be generalizing here but the fact that no one 
            stood up and told the organizers is saying something of the community. I don’t want anything to do with those group of players anymore but for the Esports 
            Negrense League I will be waiting for other tournaments that they will host since I believe that they are still helping players in a way to let them 
            experience in tournaments like this. My only concern is the people using vulgar words while playing the game and it’s really questionable and if I were 
            to change something from the project it would be to penalize players who will not act accordingly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I am now aware that although Esports will bring players together to compete and have fun there’s also another side of the coin and it’s
             the toxic behaviors that will ruin the game. I advocate sportsmanship the actions the player showed in this championship match should not be tolerated

            Our badminton coach Carmel Regencia introduces me and my varsity teammates to the 1st Kagawad LIZZA PERDICES Badminton Tournament. 
            We were told to represent the Silliman University in this event. The event was held at the Riverside Court’s, Dumaguete City 
            and its first opening 
            started on November 23 and the age category was played. But our schedule was on November 24 since we are in the level category 
            and it started at 8:30 a.m. until 9 p.m. 
            The organizer of the event was one of my past coach’s named Coach Sean Terania. In the second opening Kagawad Lizza Perdices announced the reason why she held the 
            tournament, and it was because Governor Chaco Sagarbarria asked her to sponsor a sport of her choosing and she picked badminton since it was her favorite childhood 
            sport. I was one of the representatives of the SU STALLION and we proudly represented Silliman University in this event.
        </p>
             
        <p>
            I played doubles in this event and my partner was Seth Arcamo a second-year badminton varsity player. We did our best but we stopped at the quarter 
            finals since we were defeated and I came to a realization my skills have dropped and tremendously. Before the event I was not expecting to reach the 
            quarter final because I just got back into playing badminton but we managed to get to the quarter finals which I was not within my expectation. Our opponents 
            were strong and it can be easily determined that they went through rigorous training. The people who defeated us was one of the members of the strongest team 
            here in Visayas the Jaguar Badminton Academy (JBA) and we were unlucky to be matched with them in the quarter finals. I have fought with their players before 
            and I have not won a single match. They never fail to show a good game and it is admirable. Despite losing me and my partner 
            decided that we should just practice more and continue being partners for upcoming tournaments so we can have better synchronization it was our first time teaming up.
        </p>

        <p>
            People who train deserves to win and I stopped playing for a month since I lost motivation and then it hit me. What I did was wrong and I lost most my 
            skills in just a month. But I will see this as a learning opportunity to further improve my skills and to not give up easily. I will see my self 
            participating in more badminton tournaments and since me and Coach Sean Terania are already mutuals in FB I can see if he will organize another tournament.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I realized my own lapses in my own sport. I had a weak mindset and because of this weak mindset of my I 
            lost years’ worth of consistent training by stopping a whole month. I need to find a way to strengthen it or else I will just 
            fall back again. I am thankful that I have a partner who is positive and I will look forward to playing with him in the future.
