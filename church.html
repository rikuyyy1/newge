            On November 3, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. – 10:30 a.m. on SU Church the University Christian Life and Emphasis Month (UCLEM) launching and commissioning was happening. Headed by Rev. Jonathan R. Pia the launching was a success and a start for a new Christian month commenced and I am looking forward to the activities that UCLEM has to offer. I was a spectator in this and I witnessed the official launching.
        </p>
             
        <p>
            During the mass, I learned the significance of UCLEM for Sillimanians to enhance the spiritual values of us students and to enhance their education about religion. My initial expectation for the mass was to have supporter who are willing to give their time and energy to serve for this year’s UCLEM and my expectations was satisfied. With the theme “Faith Over Fear: Facing life’s Challenges” made an impact on my self since there are lots of challenges as a student. I don’t have any specific person who made an impression on me but the number of individuals who is willing to serve and in order for this event to be successful.

        </p>

        <p>
            As I continue to the mass it made me wonder if maybe in the future I can become like those people and it really made a shift in my personal perspective as what are those people’s stories for them to willingly serve. The SU Church is a significant part of Silliman’s culture and Christian tradition so I will expect more in the future to join their events. The activity is beneficial for those students who have gone astray to the path of God and this UCLEM will help them go back due to the vast activities the month of November has to offer.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I have become more curious to what the month of November has to offer due to the vast number of activities it has. Also, I become aware of the number of individuals who are willing to serve.

        <p>
            On November 3, 2024, at 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. the UCLEM Youth Worshiping was taking place at the SU Church. Headed by Rev. Jonathtan R. Cal, individuals from Silliman gathered at SU Church on this day to take part of the Worship and that includes me. Its main objective was to strengthen the spiritual bond of individuals using the theme “Faith Over Fear: Facing life’s Giants”.



        </p>
             
        <p>
            The activity made me realize the importance of spiritual courage and I learned how to battle my inner demons thanks to the theme provided. Since it was said to be a worship, I expected it to be more on singing talented singers using their skills to use it for good. I was not disappointed. It was an activity where I witnessed the full cooperation of individuals in the mass singing in unison together with the leader. Also, in this activity I was able to witness individuals facing their own giants through prayer.
        </p>
            
           
        <p>
            The session changed my perspective about how to tackle challenges, it can be through a prayer or singing to God and offering myself to him and it’s up to me if I take action or not to face the challenges. I learned in this event that faith in God alone won’t fix your personal problems since you also need to take action.        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this activity my belief was broadened and I was able to see other people that are going through stuff gather and face their own “Giant’s”. I should take note that faith will not fix my problems since I realized that God also wants me to deal with it.        </p>

        <p>
            We had our All-colleges Midweek Convocation at the SU Church on November 20, 2024 at 6:30 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. and it was led by Prof. Jusie Lydia Siega-Sur. The purpose of the mass was to gather students from different colleges to participate in this mass and to learn more about the them. I was one of the attenders.         </p>
             
        <p>
            The event did not give me any skills but it enhanced my understating on why the theme is “Faith Over Fears: Facing Life’s Giants”. I was expecting that the church would be cramped and this was so on point and I even got separated with my classmates but I got a seat together with my seniors in CCS. With using the same them it dogged deeper on to the context of theme and there was a person who shared his story about him suffering from the cruel days of covid and the way he overcome it inspired me. The event gives me more insight on the them and with that I was able to relate it to myself. The activity was mostly students and I am sure each person in that mass has their own struggle and it reminded me to be kind no matter who I am talking to.        </p>

        <p>
            With the faith of God David killed the Goliath and I can take this as an example of being having faith and then taking action. It can be used in multiple aspects in life and with a person having a tough time it’s not always too late to turn to God. This activity is beneficial towards individuals who are struggling and don’t know what to do and this can help them get their problem fixed if they put their heart into it.         </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity it made learn more about the them and how it can be applied to life. It may look simple but it holds significant value of an individual puts their heart and soul into understanding the text. I will use this text to face my personal challenges and I believe that it will help me significantly.        </p>

        <p>
            On the 21st day of November I participated in the Galilean Fellowship at the SU amphitheater. It was organized by the USLC/Facilitators and the purpose of the Galilean Fellowship is to build the bond of students since it’s also like a get together. It also educates students about the main theme of the UCLEM and I was one of the participants on this event.        </p>
             
        <p>
                
            In this event we had a heart-to-heart talk together with my classmates in CHS class and I realize that everyone really has their own giant in their life. Since I did not know what a Galilean Fellowship is I just expected it to be a regular mass. But when the event started, I was surprised to discover that’s its more like a get together activity and for us to convey our inner giants. The activity is made me realize that no matter how small I think my problem is, it should be taken seriously since it will accumulate and will soon eat you.
        </p>

        <p>
            The experience thought me that it is important to talk to other people about your burdens or struggles since no one should be alone in this world. To continue my involvement with the group I need get updated to what they are doing and this is via social media. The event is beneficial for students to let them know that everyone’s feeling is valid and should not be afraid to speak out about their inner giants.        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            Because of this activity I was able to convey my inner giants to other people and it made me feel better and I realized that it is not so bad to talk it out with other people.

        <p>
            On November 27, 2024 I participated int the Worship Culmination about UCLEM. The event was held at the SU amphitheater. It was to commemorate the success of UCLEM for the first semester. The faculty and staff from different department participated in this event and it was mainly led by Mrs. Erelyn Renguijo-Academia, Mr. Mark Angelo Cadungog, and Ms. Enrica Dinopol.        </p>
             
        <p>
            During this event I did not learn any practical skills but I learned to appreciate the efforts of the different people behind for the success of UCLEM. The dynamic volunteer really shaped the who month of UCLEM and making it a success and I respect those individuals behind the success.        </p>

        <p>
            The experience made me realize that a huge success of events should be celebrated and to apply this learning I should learn to appreciate my little success more. The group was vibrant if I were to describe it and I would like to continue my involvement with the group and to do this I will stay updated with their announcements. The benefits of this activity are to celebrate the success of UCLEM and the people behind it will feel appreciated.        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity, it made me like the idea of celebrating success no matter how small or grand it may be. The UCLEM’s facilitators really did a great job in making the event possible and proceed without any errors.

        <p>
            On December 10, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., I was participating in a bible study at the Chapel of Evangels Benches Silliman University and it was organized by Kristine Mariel Suan from the IVCF Negros Oriental. The purpose of this bible study is to know more about God’s miracle works.        </p>
             
        <p>
            In this activity I did not learn any practical skills but I learned about God that he truly works on mysterious ways. My expectation for the event was that there would be more people but when came there were only 3 of us but that did not stop us from doing the bible study. In the study I discovered that God will heal any man if he makes himself willing to be healed. During the event ate Kristine was consistently being optimistic and I should take her as an example.        </p>

        <p>
            The experience affected my world view when I realized that no matter how dirty a person is or what type of uncurable disease he has God is willing to help that person if he will God heal him by lowering his pride and surrendering everything. I am mutuals with the organizer of the event and if she will host another bible study I will join since I believe that this is beneficial for us people since it will help us understand more about God.        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity am I am now slightly more knowledgeable about God and  I wish to enhance this knowledge by participating in more activities like this. I believe that bible studies are great ways to help people learn more about our God and as mortals we should use this opportunity to learn more about him.        </p>

        <p>
            On December 11, 2024 I attended the Holy Mass for the Investiture of Knights and Dames and Solem Conferral of Pro Ecclecia Et Pontifice Award at 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and it was led by Archbishop Charles John Brown, D. D. and it was held in the Dumaguete Cathedral. With the main goal of awarding individuals who have been doing good in their service and to conduct a new Knight and Dame.              
        <p>
            I did not learn any technical stuff in this mass but I did learn that dedication and hard work can be paid off. The mass made me realize that there are certain individuals who are really centered into religion and with that they were recognized. The presence of Archbishop Charles John Brown, D. D. who is the main lead of the mass made a significant presence in the ceremony.        </p>

        <p>
            The experience affected my world view in a way that relentless service is worth It since individuals can be awarded. It also motivated to participate more on community events in the future. The Cathedra is just a few blocks away from my house and I can easily participate in the masses.  This beneficial because it will motivate more people to serve more seriously since there is an award for it. It will serve as a motivation towards people that are interested.        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I was motivated to serve not only in church but to other aspects as well that can benefit other people. I will try to serve more in church and in the community by joining events such as clean up drives, blood donation, tree planting and future masses.        </p>

        <p>
            On December 16, 2024 at 4:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  I attending the the 1st Misa de Aquinaldo which was held in Dumaguete City. The main goal of the 1st Misa De Aquinaldo is to prepare for Christmas by attending the nine-day novena until reaching the birth of Jesus Christ.        </p>
             
        <p>
            In the event I have learned the importance of this mass and it is more about my spiritual reflections like what is the meaning of this mass and as to why we do it. I anticipated that the atmosphere of the cathedral would be more spiritual and I can attest to this since even if I am outside, I can still feel the ambiance of the mass resonating withing and out of the cathedral. The whole experience made my spiritual understanding on the mass deeper and even if I am outside with no chairs I did not consider it as a negative sign since I don’t want to be pessimistic Infront of the lord.         </p>

        <p>
            Even though it is early in the morning there were plenty of people gathering for a single mass causing the inner parts of the church to be quickly populated. With this information I realized there are plenty of people who would get up in the morning and give their time and effort to the lord and I can say from there actions that individuals who gathered there really have a deep faith and I am inspired by this.        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I become gained knowledge as to why people are performing this task and I also learned that there are plenty of people would give their time and energy to attend a mass so early in the morning.        </p>
