        <p>
            August 20, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. I joined as a participant and the jackbox game which was hosted by the Confederates Student Council and it was held at the CC building in SU. The reason for this activity is for students to have fun and to enhance their cognitive abilities.         </p>
             
        <p>
            I learned that there are many students who are very witty and come up with quick answerers right away leading to them winning the game. On my behalf, I also learned that compared to other students I am not that quick to get the answers write. I did no really expect anything from the game it just surprised me that there are plenty of bright minds in my department. They were plenty of them who could get the answers quickly and I was just sitting there in awe. Despite not winning much I did no lose my motivation and continued to play.
        </p>

        <p>
            The experience made me realize that there are many talented individuals in our department and I realized that I should step up my game. Sir Te was actually the host and I like him I will immediately get in touch if there is an event that is hosted by him. The gam is beneficial for those students who wants to test their abilities in thinking.        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because of this activity I realized my lapses and I should take motivation from this to further enhance my abilities so that I can catch up to people who are better than me. I also like to thank this activity for assessing my current capabilities.

            On September 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. there was a Freshman Orientation that was organized by the Confederates Students Council ta ATA hall SU and it ended at 10:30 a.m. I participated in this event since I am a freshman and this activity will brief us on what we should know about our own college.


        </p>
             
        <p>
            In this event, I learned the dos and donâ€™ts of the college. My first expectation was that I would be an hour only but I did not expect it to last long. The orientation made me realize how important it is to follow the rules and regulation of the College our there will be negative consequences. It was my first time at ATA hall at that time and it was freezing cold.        </p>
            
           
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I was made aware of the stuff that I should be prioritize on doing and the stuff that I should not be doing since there will be terrible consequences to follow.

        <h2>Campus Tour</h2>

        <p>
            The name of the event is Campus Tour it was held at Silliman University on September 25, 2024, at 1:30 PM - 3 PM the person who guided us was a member of the college ambassador of Silliman named Christian Jed Culanculan The topic was mainly about the history of Silliman, the buildings, and why they were created. My role in the activity is a participant since it was one of our requirements for GE10.             
        </p>
            <p>
                During the activity, I did not learn any skills. Although, I did learn about the history of Silliman thanks to our tour guide's brief and concise explanation. Before the event began, I thought that it would just be a boring tour since I was not interested in going. But as the tour began the energy of the tour guide shifted my thoughts and made me interested in the history of my college. With the guide's energy and enthusiasm, I became interested in the activity since he made me pay attention.  Fortunately, nothing went wrong with the event that might have caused me a negative experience.  I have said that I initially did not want to go but fortunately, I did. I learned that I should not be such a pessimist because I might miss a lot of interesting things.                
        </p>
        <p>
            After the activity was finished it changed my perspective on Silliman. I was already well aware that Silliman is one of the prestigious schools here in Dumaguete but I was not aware that Silliman had a deep historical heritage and that Silliman had a huge role during WW2. I like our tour guide such as how he articulates his words and I know more of him are among the campus ambassadors if I soon have friends who are interested in learning the history of my college, I will surely introduce them to Silliman's College Ambassadors. The activity will help new students of Silliman to learn more about the historical background of the University and how significant each building is.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I am now well aware of the historical background of Silliman. Also, due to this event, I realized how deep the historical heritage of my college is and I am grateful that this was one of the requirements for GE10.

            On October 12, 2024, at 3:00 p.m. until 3500 p.m. there was a meeting for the Sports Committee. It was organized by the President which is Keonah Kiss and I am a member of sports com. So, I attended the meeting. The main reason for this meeting is to brief the point person and members on what will be happening during intramurals try outs.</p>

        <p>
                
I learned how active Keonah is when it comes to activities like this and I respect her for that. My initial expectation for this activity was that everything would go smoothly and fortunately it did. The meeting made me wonder that are the students the only ones managing the tasks? It really surpised me since my previous school teachers would be the one to organized. I really respect the initiative of Keonah is and also the other volunteers.        </p>

        <p>
            The event changes my view about the culture of Silliman that the students are the one responsible for organizing the events happening. By being active in the group chat and joining group activities I can involve myself with the group more. The activity is beneficial for people who wants to know more about what will be the flow of the try outs and to make sure that there will be no errors so that everything will run smoothly. </p>        
        <p>
            
            Because of this activity I was made aware of how things operate when it comes to events like this. Students are the ones responsible for making the event come alive and with the initiative of active members It will happen.        </p>

        <p>
            I participated in an Mental Health Literacy workshop on October 16, 2024, from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., It was held at the ATA HALL in SU and the event was organized by Isable Jones. The purpose of the activity is to inform the participants the significance of Mental Health. </p>

        <p>
During the event I learned that mental health should be taken seriously. My initial expectations were that the workshop would just focus more on the theory, but it surprised me that the people Infront where also interacting with the participants. The person who caught my attention in the event was Isabel Jones since she was able to help the idea of a mental health literacy workshop come to life and she gained my respect for it. It helped me appreciate how important mental health is. </p>

        <p>
            This activity helped me widen my perspective about mental health and that mental health is just as important as the physical if not more. By being active in our GC I will be notified if their group posted anything. The activity is beneficial since it helps individual suffering from mental health feel home and the event also make a sense a community for mental health advocates. </p>

        <p>
Because of this activity, I am more knowledgeable than before about the importance of mental health and how serious it is. Mental Health should be talked more often since here in the Philippines you will get shunned if you show any sign if reaction that people might consider as OA.

        <h2>Launching of the VOLUNTEERING NETWORK PROGRAM</h2>

        <p>
            The Volunteering Network program is an organization where individuals can have the ability to volunteer by helping the community. The program was held in Oriental Hall (OH) and officially began its launching on Nov 13, 2024, at 1 PM .It was hosted by the SUSG Social Services Committee, and one of the lead organizers was Angelina Athena Rival. But unfortunately, I did not see the event through since I had another activity set on the same day so I left at around 2:30 PM. The people involved in organizing the event were individuals from the SUSG Social Services Committee who have a strong drive to lend their hands to people in need. During the event, they discussed the importance of the organization and what we would be doing if we were to participate in volunteering. Also, during the event people who had a lot of experience in volunteering introduced themselves and their background and it showed how genuine their intentions are by showcasing all the stuff that they have done. The main objective of the event was to gather those who are interested in volunteering and to inspire individuals to participate in community events. During the activity, I was one of the independent participants, unlike some participants who went carrying their organization's name. </p>

        <p>
By actively listening to the different people talking regarding their vast experience in volunteering I have learned that there are people who would give away their resources to help those people in need. I was inspired by their actions and when I viewed myself doing the things that they did I was motivated to become a part of their program. My initial expectation for the event is that I will see some people who are advocates and do the words that they preach. As the launching proceeded, they continued to prove my expectations of their program and I was surprised to see many active volunteers in the program. The program made me realize that I too can be a part of these volunteers. Angelina Athena Rival was an active volunteer since her high school days unlike myself who was just always doing stuff that did not have any significant contributions to society. She made me realize that if my intentions are genuine, I too can help out and be an active member of society. The launching of the program made me realize that simple help can positively change someone's life.</p>
        <p>
            My worldview before was just going with the flow of life and I did not care about others.  As I continued to listen to the guests at the events, I learned that I could join certain events and volunteer and actively participate in lending my hand to others. I believe that if continue to indulge myself in their programs it will help me learn new things in life. To do that I should stay active on the group chat of the program to see if there are any events related to volunteering then I will join. By actively participating in the activity, I can see myself benefiting from it since it will help me learn and experience new things in life. More importantly, not only I will be benefiting from its people in need can also benefit by my joining the program and actively participating in it. </p>        
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I am now inspired to volunteer in certain programs that can help people in the community and it also changed my personal views positively. I believe that by joining this program I can be an active member of the community helping people in need by volunteering myself.</p>

        <h2>Bonsai Exhibition</h2>

        <hr />

        

        <div class="img_container1">
            <img src="classroom_bon.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
            The activity was a bonsai exhibition that was held at Silliman University Arineo Art Gallery. Its first official opening was on November 6, 2024, and it ended on November 23, 2024. The event was organized by the Negros Island BOnsai and Suiseki Society (NIBOSS). The main objective of this exhibition is to showcase the different bonsai art that was created by local artists. During the activity, I was a mere spectator observing the different artworks in the gallery since it was a requirement for our GE6 subject. I took my time roaming and looking for potential artwork to add to my assignment.  I chose an artwork that I think is distinctive and has a deep meaning. I also considered the requirement for the GE10 that the student should spend an hour in the event for it to be considered an official event in my journal.  I went to the event on November 15 from 2:30 and left around 3:30 but I did not see the organizers only students who were also required to join and the person responsible for our attendance. This event is essential for the bonsai art to be exposed more in the region and to help the artist gain the recognition that they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the event I did not gain any skills, but as I explored the different artworks, I began to appreciate the patience of the artist in creating those bonsai. My first expectation of the event was to find a bonsai that I believe has a deep meaning so that I can add it to my assignment in GE6. Fortunately, I found a piece that I think was an artwork worthy to be added to my assignment. I won't elaborate more on it since it's a 300-word essay but it was more about the resilience of mother nature and how the artwork can be reflected in the perspective of humans. The only thing that surprised me was the ambiance of the gallery. Together with the bonsai artworks it gives a feeling of being in ancient China. </p>

        <p>
When I was roaming, I began to ponder on the idea of how much time and effort this artist put into creating these artworks. With that, I realized that this artist shows that they are dedicated to the things that they do and that idea stuck to my head. When I came to the event there were not a lot of people and I did not see anyone who picked my interest. But I appreciate each artist who puts their time and effort into creating visually appealing artworks. The most difficult part was staying for an hour and there were only limited artworks to look at. But although it was boring, I know it is important to appreciate artwork that was made by local artists since it can help them tremendously. Showing support to different artists will make them feel that there are people who appreciate their artwork and if there are any events similar to this (EXHIBITION) I will show my support. On my end, I don't see any benefit from the event but for the artist, it will show that people are appreciating their artworks since people show up to their exhibition. Also, if there is any possibility that I will do this project I would increase the number of bonsai displayed so that people can explore more.</p>        
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I am now aware that even in the Philippines people are doing bonsai artwork and as a Filipino, I think this is important since this type of art requires long amounts of time and it truly shows that Filipinos are capable of doing this works such as this.</p>

            Technology Courses Accenture Academy is a program that will have students be in touch with the latest technology on this day to help them apply for future jobs. They were introducing their programs to seniors in CCS to help students/graduates who are lost in their path of technology. This was held at the Audio-Visual Studio Theater at Silliman University on November 19, 2024, from 1 PM - 4:30 PM. It was organized by the Confederates Student Council and the main topic when I came in the host was talking about the possible things students can do if they are in the programs. I say this because I came in late at 3 PM and until the end at 4:30. The people present in this activity were the Confederate Student Council, senior students, the host of the program, and our college dean. I am not part of the seniors so I just came to Audio Visual Studio Theater to be educated about the said event. </p>             
        <p>
            In this discussion, I learned that there are multiple ways to gain knowledge about the newest technologies present and the programs just offer those things that I need to learn. At this event I expected it to be more packed but only around 60% of the chairs were occupied. Maybe the college that I am in is hard so only a few seniors are available.  During the event, the speaker was calm and actively engaging with the audience and I believe that is essential to get people interested in the topic that you are discussing. He stood out the most to me since of course he is the person in front and I like how articulate he is. During the discussion, I felt overwhelmed knowing that there are plenty of things that I still need to learn for me to become a full-fledged IT guy but others. Also, the good part about the meeting is that they let someone who is not invited in. </p>
        <p>
            During the event, I learned that I know so little about the field that I am in and I need to step up my game if I want to pass and become exceptional. Their program is accessible online and with that, I can learn more about what they can offer. The activity is beneficial for students who are lost in their path and don't know what to do when they graduate and help them out. Overall, the event was good and it accommodated the students well and I don't think there's any need for changes. </p>        
        <p>
            Because of this activity, I am able to have a grasp of what I will do in the future to further improve my skills in tech and what specific road I should take. This is all thanks to Accenture who explained what are the things that I should do to get better. </p>
